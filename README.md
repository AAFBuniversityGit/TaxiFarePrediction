# TaxiFarePrediction

## Overview
The TaxiFarePrediction project aims to predict taxi fares using machine learning, specifically leveraging ML.NET. By analyzing various factors like trip distance, time of day, and pickup/dropoff locations, the model can estimate the fare for a given taxi ride with high accuracy.

## Features
- **ML.NET Integration**: Seamlessly build, train, and deploy machine learning models for fare prediction.
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling and preprocessing of input data for optimal model performance.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to ensure the modelâ€™s reliability and accuracy.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK
- ML.NET
- A dataset containing historical taxi ride data

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TaxiFarePrediction.git
    cd TaxiFarePrediction
    ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Restore the NuGet packages:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

### Usage
1. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to build the predictive model using the provided dataset.
2. **Predict Fares**: Use the trained model to predict fares for new taxi rides.
