        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The TaxiFarePrediction project leverages machine learning to predict taxi fares based on features like
            vendor ID, rate code, passenger count, trip distance, and payment type. This model is built using ML.NET and
            trained on historical taxi trip data.
        </p>

        <h2>How the Program Works</h2>
        <p>
            This project involves three main steps:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training the Model:</strong> A regression model is trained using a dataset of historical taxi
                trip data, which includes features such as trip distance and passenger count.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluating the Model:</strong> The model's performance is evaluated on test data, with metrics
                such as RSquared and Root Mean Squared Error used to assess its accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Making Predictions:</strong> The trained model is used to predict the fare for new taxi trips
                based on the same set of features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Detailed Code Explanation</h2>
        <h3>1. Data Loading and Transformation</h3>
        <p>
            The data is loaded from CSV files containing historical taxi trip data. The key features include
            <strong>Vendor ID</strong>, <strong>Rate Code</strong>, <strong>Passenger Count</strong>, <strong>Trip
                Distance</strong>, and <strong>Payment Type</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Model Training</h3>
        <p>
            The model is trained using the FastTree algorithm, a decision tree-based method suitable for regression
            tasks. The features are transformed using one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and then combined into
            a single feature vector.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Model Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
            After training, the model is evaluated using test data. Key metrics include <strong>RSquared</strong>, which
            indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data, and <strong>Root Mean Squared
                Error</strong>, which measures the average prediction error.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Predicting Taxi Fares</h3>
        <p>
            The model is then used to predict the fare for a single taxi trip. The predicted fare is compared with the
            actual fare to assess the model's accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Potential enhancements include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporating additional features such as traffic data, weather conditions, and time of day.</li>
            <li>Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.</li>
            <li>Deploying the model as a web service for real-time fare predictions.</li>
        </ul>
